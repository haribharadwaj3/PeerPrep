This project focuses on developing PeerPrep, an online platform 
designed to help students connect with their peers through study 
groups. Key features include the ability to create and join public or 
private study groups, enabling collaborative learning. The platform 
also offers an invite system for users to invite others based on 
their usernames. A user-friendly interface allows easy navigation 
between group creation, joining, and interaction. PeerPrep aims to 
enhance student engagement by fostering subject-specific 
discussions and knowledge sharing. The system showcases how 
technology can facilitate peer collaboration and support efficient 
learning, providing a dynamic space for students to share 
resources, ask questions, and collaborate on academic goals.
